##Description
Horiseon is a web application used to help improve search engine optimization. I have been tasked with refactoring the index.html and style.css files to create a more coesive format of the coding by including elemental semantics.   

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
- To optimize the search engine and understand the elemental semantics of the index.html and style.css files.
- 
- Why did you build this project? 
- To better understand the format and elemental semantics needed to structure both the index.html and style.css files.
- 
- What problem does it solve? 
- Simplifying the code and elemental commands to better understand the layout of the index.html and style.css files.
- 
- What did you learn?
- I learned that refactoring both the index.html and the style.css files the coding can be simplified and cleaner for other software developers to catch any bugs.
